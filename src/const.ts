However, conventional approaches for motion estimation such as video point tracking and video instance segmentation, often fall short in accurately representing the trajectories of multiple points of a target instance. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel approach: Instance Motion Trajectory Estimation (IMTE). IMTE is specifically designed to tackle each challenge of video segmentation and point tracking concurrently, offering a more holistic approach to estimating motion trajectories in intricate video scenes. Our key discovery is that both the tracking and the segmentation significantly bolster each other through their synergistic effects within the IMTE framework. For example, the segmentation can guide better tracking by offering semantically related points in the queried frame, and conversely, the tracking can guide the accurate instance location to foundational segmentation models (e.g., segment anything) to enable video instance segmentation in a unified framework. Throughout extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ITME in improving motion estimation performances in terms of the existing video segmentation and point tracking benchmarks. For example, on the recent TAP-Vid benchmark, our framework consistently improves the tracking performance, e.g., 13.6% improvement on the standard Jaccard metric. Furthermore, we found our point tracking results can lead to enhanced zero-shot video instance segmentation results, with up to 14.7% improvement compared to baselines on the segmentation score.`;
